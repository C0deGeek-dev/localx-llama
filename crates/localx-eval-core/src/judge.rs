//! LLM-as-judge: a model scores the code-quality dimensions static signals
//! cannot see — readability, idiomatic style, the right abstraction, and
//! latent-bug risk — to complement the deterministic `quality` block.
//!
//! The discipline that makes the scores trustworthy is built in:
//! - **Blinded by construction.** Single-solution scoring embeds no arm identity
//!   in the prompt, so the judge cannot tell one harness arm from another. A
//!   comparative preference call presents the two solutions in a **seed-randomized
//!   order** and maps the verdict back, so order is not a tell.
//! - **Offline-deterministic.** [`Judge::score_offline`] answers from a cache
//!   keyed by the exact prompt, so CI never needs a model; a live path is the
//!   host's to supply (it holds the model client) and caches its responses here.
//! - **Calibrated.** [`cohens_kappa`] scores the judge against a human-labelled
//!   sample so agreement is reported, not assumed. The judge model must be
//!   stronger than the subject model (documented; the caller configures it).
//!
//! The rubric and prompt are original artefacts authored for this stack.
